## Installation

To set up the Terreform project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avorakh/rsschool-devops-course-tasks.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd rsschool-devops-course-tasks/task-01
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**: Initialize the Terraform working directory. This step downloads the necessary provider plugins:

   ```bash
   # backend.conf file
   bucket  = "<PUT-S3-BUCKET-NAME-FOR-TERRAFORM-STATES>"
   region  = "<PUT-AWS-REGION>"
   key     = "state/terraform.tfstate"
   encrypt = true
   ```

   ```bash
   terraform init -backend-config=./path/to/backend.conf
   ```

## Usage

To use the Terreform project, follow these steps:

1. **Plan the Infrastructure**: Generate and review an execution plan for the infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

   This command will show you what actions Terraform will take to change your infrastructure.

2. **Apply the Infrastructure**: Apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the action when prompted. Terraform will provision the resources as defined in the configuration files.

3. **Destroy the Infrastructure**: If you need to remove the infrastructure, use the following command:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

   Confirm the action when prompted. This will delete all the resources managed by Terraform.
